# Interconnected Markets Dashboard

## Overview
The **Interconnected Market** dashboard – my very own mini crystal ball into the world of stocks and commodities! Picture this: an interactive Power BI dashboard covering the returns of nineteen major stock markets, from the mighty US Dow Jones and S&P to the UK, Germany, France, and Spain, alongside key commodities like gold, Brent oil, and... orange juice. (Yes, I’m as surprised as you are that OJ made the cut, but hey, it turns out markets and breakfast beverages have more in common than you'd think!)

The project captures data from 2008 to 2024, revealing patterns, trends, and even some juicy correlations between stocks and commodities over time. I also threw in global events as a kind of “historical spice” to show how everything from recessions to booms has affected these returns. It’s a one-stop shop for spotting trends or understanding how a financial crisis or a global supply chain issue might send shockwaves from Wall Street to your morning juice!

So, if you've ever wondered if an oil spike could leave you crying over your stock portfolio or if gold prices really glitter when markets tank – this dashboard has your answer
